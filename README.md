# OlShot
This is an Arduino based Shooting game system. Free to use, you need to make the components your self.

It's wireless and uses nrf24l01 modules to communicate to the targets and the main system.

## How mutch does it cost to buid ?
Well it will cost you some money, for the components, and maufactoring the pcb, **BUT** to have your custom build game is priceless.

### Target PCB
**2023-02-05: The Target PCB Is now avalible for kicad and arduino code.**

Did a redesign of the target sensor, everything is now on the top side. Added jst connections instead of soldering.
