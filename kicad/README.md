# Kicad Files

This is the place you will find KiCad files.

They are designed in KiCad 6

Inside Library folder you find custom footprints that needed. 

## Use of files
You are free to do changes and copy to your custom builds if you want.

You can also use them without changes. You are not allowed to use my design as is to make money on it.

There a lot of hours spent on develop this so, use it but don't be a millionare on it.
