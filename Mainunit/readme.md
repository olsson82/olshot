## The Main Unit
Here is all you need to work with the main unit.

**This code is still in BETA, the clock function is not yet built in**

The HMI file is for the Nextion Editor to design your layout. Or if you are lacy just use the tft file to upload the design on the Nextion (read the WIKI)

Please read the wiki about everything you need to know for the code. You need to do some adjustments in some librarys.
